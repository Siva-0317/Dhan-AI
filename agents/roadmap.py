- Monte Carlo Success Rate at age 65: {success_rate:.1f}%
- Expert Advice Context: {rag_context[:500]}

Create a practical 6-month action roadmap. Follow this strict priority:
Month 1-2: Emergency Fund (6x monthly expenses)
Month 3: Insurance (term + health)
Month 4-5: Eliminate high-interest debt (above 12%)
Month 6: Begin SIP investments

RULES:
- The "roadmap" array MUST have EXACTLY 6 items (month 1 through 6).
- Each "amount" is a realistic monthly INR figure (not yearly, not cumulative).
- The "summary" is 2-3 sentences max, casual coach tone, mentions persona and success rate.
- Use ONLY Indian Rupees (Rs.). No dollar signs.

Return ONLY this exact JSON structure, no markdown, no extra text:
{{"roadmap": [{{"month": 1, "action": "...", "amount": 15000}}, ...6 items total], "summary": "..."}}"""
