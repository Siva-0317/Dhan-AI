Generate a realistic month-by-month financial roadmap. 
You MUST strictly follow this priority order for allocation and tasks:
1. Establish an emergency fund of 6 months' expenses.
2. Get term and health insurance.
3. Clear high-interest debt (>12%).
4. Start goal-based SIPs.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with NO extra text or markdown formatting. The JSON must have exactly two keys:
1. "roadmap": A JSON array where each item has "month" (integer, 1 for month 1, 2 for month 2, etc.), "action" (string), and "amount" (float).
2. "summary": A friendly plain-text summary explaining this overall roadmap to the user directly, written like an expert coach. Highlight their FI success rate and their persona.
